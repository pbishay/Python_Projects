# Python_Projects
Hi!
My name is Peter Bishay and this is a repository for any past or current projects I have worked on. This is mostly for employers who are interested in my programming abilities and future collaborators, but anyone is welcome. 

My interests/focus in coding is to conduct data/statistical analysis more effectively

I have seperated projects in branches. This main branch will only contain this text document to explain the projects in the other branches.

Branch 1: Agent-Based Model
This was an agent-based model I worked on with a colleague for a computational social science course in grad school. The aim of the model is to have agents learn individually and as teams from continuous stress events. There is a lot that had not been added in this stage, but this sets a good framework for the exogenous stress shocks, measuring team/individual resilience, and conducting sensitivity testing. The aim of the project is to create a simulation that can measure how resilience changes over time and what factors are important for a team to sucessfully function. I would be happy to provide more specific details, as well as send a research paper which goes over the literature on the subjects of agent learning, team resilience, and methedology behind the model.

Branch 2: Random Stuff
Random Stuff has things I found were interesting, but not really a project.
