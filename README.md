# Python_Projects
Hi!
My name is Peter Bishay and this is a repository for any past or current projects I have worked on. This is mostly for employers who are interested in my programming abilities and future collaborators, but anyone is welcome. 

My interests/focus in coding is to conduct data/statistical analysis more effectively
