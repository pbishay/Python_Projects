# Python_Projects
Hi!
This GitHub repository is mostly for employers who are interested in my programming abilities and future collaborators, but anyone is welcome. 

My name is Peter Bishay, I am a recent economics master's graduate, and this is a repository for any past or current projects. I began programming in Python in January 2020 and fell in love with it and its applications in research/data analysis.

My interest/focus in coding is to conduct data/statistical analysis more effectively.

I have separated projects into branches. This main branch will only contain this text document to explain the projects in the other branches.

# Branch 1: Agent-Based Model
This is an agent-based model I worked on with a colleague named Tahir Hafeez for a computational social science course in grad school. The model aims to have agents learn individually and as teams from continuous stress events. There is a lot that had not been added in this stage, but this sets a good framework for the exogenous stress shocks, measuring team/individual resilience, and conducting sensitivity testing. The project aims to create a simulation that can measure how resilience changes over time and what factors are important for a team to successfully function. I would be happy to provide more specific details, as well as send a research paper that goes over the literature on the subjects of agent learning, team resilience, and methodology behind the model.

# Branch 2: Random Stuff
Random Stuff has things I found were interesting, but not actual projects. It holds little things I've worked on/created for school or work. 
Rock paper scissors is a simple agent-based model that allows for n number of players to play rock paper scissors with each other and receive a point if they win. Two groups compete, and the model calculates the average payout. The interesting implications of this are it allows for evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies 

Random Sampling calculates the mean of n number of values which are taken from a given distribution and plots them in a histogram. It is expected with a large enough sample, regardless of the distribution, the data will look normal. 

Flip Coin creates a bucket from 0 to 12. Given n samples of 12 flips, 1000 experiments, and p probability for heads, how many of those flips will have zero tails, 1 tails, etc. 

# Branch 3: Risk-Preferences
This model is aimed at assessing the degree of risk-averseness by looking at the choices an individual is predicted to make when choosing between lottery bundles, given human input for a list of questions that the model asks. The model creates a utility function for the user, and that utility function then makes lottery choices between 2 lotteries. It is also tested with a predefined risk-averse utility function and risk-taking utility function. This was created for a school project for a grad class, but is not sophisticated enough to give very detailed estimates of risk-averseness. 

# Branch 4: Clustering Algorithm
I am currently working on creating a k-means clustering algorithm. The aim of this algorithm, and generally for a k-means clustering algorithm, is to define a number of clusters for data points in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. Based on the distance of points from each other, the algorithm finds an optimal solution that minimizes variance between the points. This is relevant to machine learning and useful in real-life applications such as  geographical data (lat/long), analyzing data by clustering it and creating a model with the cluster as a parameter, etc. You can check out my current progress as I continue to work on this!

# Future Projects
My future projects in python revolve around automating data collection (things like web scraping, which I have been playing around with), creating appealing and interactive visuals (pandas plotly, and mathplotlib), and machine learning.
